	<h3>Personal Floatation Devices (PFDs)</h3>
	<p>The most important things to look for in a kayaking PFD, aka "life jacket" are fit and comfort. BTW, PFD is short for Personal
	Flotation Device (not to be confused with a "pdf" which is a computer file type for pictures). Kayaker's, canoer's etc. use USCG 
	Type III or V PFDs. The Type V PFD that some kayakers choose typically looks like a Type III PFD except it has a quick release 
	webbing belt above the waist which can be used for towing kayaks and other rescues.</p>

<p>There's no way to generalize all the factors that go into finding a good fit, so we go into detail about that in our individual 
descriptions of each PFD we sell, and we stock a wide variety of Men's and Women's kayaking PFDs by Kokatat, Astral, and Stohlquist.
 Kayakers are the most demanding of all PFD users, so over the past few decades it has been kayaking PFD's the have led the way to 
 better fitting PFD's. First Lotus Designs (now Astral), then Kokatat and Stohlquist built modern kayaking life jackets made of more
 durable materials with more pockets, lash tabs for knives, and other safety features. These features also make kayaking PFDs popular
 for canoeing, rafting, and sailing. PFD's for kayaking need to be short so your sprayskirt won't push them up when sitting. 
 Unfortunately as PFD's get shorter, they get thicker because you have to put the flotation somewhere. When taken to an extreme, 
 this gives some of the river kayaking PFD's a thick "blocky" look and feel, but with a few exceptions, most PFD's designed for 
 kayaking are also the best in terms of fit and comfort for canoeing, rafting, and sailing. Now that manufacturers offer women's 
 life jackets, most women are better off with a women's model. Women generally have smaller diameter upper arms, so women's fit 
 PFDs have smaller arm holes which helps prevent the jacket from floating up around your face when swimming. Some guys find they 
 initially like the fit of women's PFDs, but due to the smaller arm holes on women's models, a guy is likely to get chaffing under 
 the arms after a long day of paddling.

	<h3> Float Plan</h3>
	<p>Complete this plan before you go boating and leave it with a reliable person who can be depended upon to notify the Coast
	Guard, or other rescue agency, should you not return or check-in as planned. If you have a change of plans, or will be delayed,
	notify the person holding your Float Plan.

 <h3>Don't Be Stupid</h3>
 <p>It is important to check conditions such as weather and tides before going out in your kayak. Whether you are going on a 
 multi-day excursion or just paddling for an afternoon, being aware of current conditions can help you plan a more safe and 
 efficient trip. An excellent way to monitor sea conditions is to use the National Marine Forecast located at
 www.weather.gov/om/marine/home.htm
