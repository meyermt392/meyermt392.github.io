	<h2>Transcript</h2>
	<p>
	My favorite sports team is the Detroit Lions. I’m from Michigan and used to the Thanksgiving
	game every year. Despite beating the Pats early on things aren’t going so great right now. 
	Or ever….Their record is 3-6 and they are on a 3 game losing streak. This year they have a 
	new coach, Matt Patricia, who used to be the Defensive Coordinator for the Patriots. 
	Hopefully Patricia will be able to turn things around, but it’s not looking too good at 
	the moment. The Lions have struggled for quite some time. The last playoff game they won was 
	in 1992.
