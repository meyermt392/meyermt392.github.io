<p> I have very little background with the subject material. My only introduction to any of this was in an information systems class that covered HTML for a few weeks.
It's been at least 4 or 5 years since taking the class so it's not exactly fresh in my mind. </p>

<h2> My Interest in Web Development </h2>

<p> To be honest, I have very little interest in web development. I am the opposite of a "tech guy" and try to avoid screens whenever possible. It's definitely very important 
though. There's clearly a ton of work that goes into creating some of the more intricate websites. </p>

<h2> Hobbies </h2>

<p> I'm an avid fisherman and kayaker. I enjoy nature. </p>

<h2> What I hope to gain from course </h2>

<p> Some basic knowledge about something I know next to nothing about </p>

<h2> Topics or Ideas I Would Like to Discuss and Learn About </h2>

<p> Anything that is practical. This is my last semester at BC so it'd be nice to go over some of these new technologies frequently used in the business world. 
Teaching the in depth mechanics of HTML in a class with many non-IT majors seems completely impractical. No one will use that knowledge in practice unless they are
 going into the field. </p>
